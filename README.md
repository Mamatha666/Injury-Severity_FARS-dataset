The FARS (Fatality Analysis Reporting System) dataset is a collection of data on traffic
accidents and fatalities in the United States. It is provided by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA) and is widely used for research and analysis on traffic
safety. The dataset includes information on the individuals involved in the crash, the vehicles
involved, and the circumstances of the crash. It is used to understand the causes of traffic
fatalities and to develop strategies for reducing the number of deaths on the nation's
highways.


A random forest model is a powerful tool for injury severity classification, and it is able to
improve the generalization of the model to new data, as well as reduce the overfitting that can
occur with a single decision tree.
